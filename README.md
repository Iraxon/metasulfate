# Metasulfate

Metasulfate is a purely functional expression-oriented programming language.

## Using Metasulfate

Right now, the easiest way to use Metasulfate is to copy paste the interpreter's source code
into your own IDE and run it. Changing this will be first priority once language design itself is done.

## Example Program

See [`!example.meso`](https://github.com/Iraxon/metasulfate/blob/main/src/main/resources/metasulfate/!example.meso).

## License

Metasulfate is free and open source software under the GNU GPL v3 or later.
