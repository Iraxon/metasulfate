# Metasulfate

Metasulfate is a purely functional, expression-oriented, programming language.

## Using Metasulfate

Right now, the easiest way to use Metasulfate is to copy paste the interpreter's source code
into your own IDE and run it. Changing this will be first priority once language design itself is done.

## Example Program

See [`!sanity_check.meso`](https://github.com/Iraxon/metasulfate/blob/main/!sanity_check.meso). The indentation helps
readability by nesting argument under the functions they are supplied to, but it is not significant to the interpreter.
The square-bracked expression is a function definition. The special value DOT stands for the input of the function.

## License

Metasulfate is free and open source software under the GNU GPL v3 or later.
